# SelfTune 5-in-1 Plugin by PAXECT Interface





# PAXECT SelfTune Plugin — Cross-Platform Autotune Enterprise Suite

**A cross-platform, self-tuning engine that combines five adaptive control techniques in one module: guard mode, overhead control, logging, smoothing, and auto-learning. 100% deterministic. Zero AI.**

_Optimized for Linux, Windows, macOS, FreeBSD, Android, and iOS — plug-and-play with zero dependencies and no vendor lock-in._

---

## Overview

The **PAXECT SelfTune Plugin** is an enterprise-ready, open-source solution designed for performance tuning, automation, and local observability.  
It operates fully offline — combining precision control and runtime learning for adaptive optimization across diverse environments.

> **Key features**
> - Guard mode with auto-failover  
> - Dynamic overhead control  
> - Smart logging & smoothing  
> - Self-learning without AI  
> - Ready for CI/CD, runtime analytics, and secure environments
