# PAXECT Enterprise Pack Overview

Welcome!  
This document describes the **Enterprise Pack vision** for the PAXECT ecosystem.  
It explains what is open source today, and what may become part of future enterprise-grade extensions.

---

## Scope
The **open-source core** will always remain free and Apache-2.0 licensed:
- PAXECT-Core (deterministic runtime)
- AEAD-Hybrid plugin (secure AEAD bridge)
- Polyglot plugin (cross-language data flow)
- SelfTune plugin (adaptive control logic)
- Link plugin (relay + policy layer)
- Demo suite (00â€“12) and CI matrix

The **Enterprise Pack** adds optional capabilities for organizations that need
operational support, integrations, or compliance tooling.

---

## Vision
The Enterprise Pack is designed to **extend** PAXECT â€” not replace it.  
It focuses on:
- Advanced **security integration** (HSM / KMS / Vault)
- Extended **policy and audit** engine
- **Monitoring connectors** (Prometheus, Grafana, Splunk, Kafka)
- **Deployment assets** (systemd units, Helm charts, Docker images)
- **Compliance documentation** (ISO / IEC / NIST mappings)
- Optional **priority support** through verified partners

---

## Community & Ownership
- The PAXECT **Core** stays fully open source.  
- The Enterprise Pack remains **proprietary** to the project Owner.  
- Future **partners or maintainers** may co-develop or maintain enterprise extensions.
- No vendor lock-in: organizations can always use the Core independently.

---

## Participation
At this stage:
- We **do not sell or distribute** enterprise packages yet.
- We **welcome volunteers and partners** interested in helping define or test enterprise extensions.
- If youâ€™re exploring integration, reach out via

## Key principle
> **Open Core. Verified Extensions. Zero telemetry by default.**

The goal is to provide a trustworthy foundation for both community users and enterprises â€”  
a system that remains deterministic, private, and reproducible across all environments.
